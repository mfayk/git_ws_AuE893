# AuE8930: Autonomy Science and Systems
This is a git repo for the Clemson class AuE893 spring 2021.  I am Max Faykus I am a computer engineering PhD student taking this course and created this repo to 
contain my code for the projects and assignments assigned for this class.  This repo will only contain the source (src) from my ROS catkin workspace this is done do to 
github storage space restrictions.


The src file will contain the assignemnt, all my scripts, launch files and videos recording the results.  each assignment also has a Readme giving instructions on
how to run the files.  videos will also display running the code.
